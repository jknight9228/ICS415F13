	In order to grab data from Xbox, we are using <a href="https://www.xboxleaders.com/">Xbox Leaders API</a><br>
	The XboxLeaders API allows developers to access public Xbox LIVE data in order to encourage app development 
	around the Xbox LIVE service. It also is open source and was available for us to use.<br>
	<br>
	XboxLeaders uses JSON to request data from official Xbox servers and returns its back in a format that is readable.<br>
