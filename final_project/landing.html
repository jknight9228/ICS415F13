As avid gamers, we decided to do a project that lines up with our interests. <br>
We are grabbing player's data from official Xbox servers and are displaying 
here in a easy to use search function.<br>
<br>
With use of JSON, we are able to grab all the data we need. Below is a sample of the data sent
back with use of XboxLeader's API.<br>
<br>
For those of you familiar, it will return items like profile name, achievement score, and games recently played.
